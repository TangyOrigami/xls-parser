    - [!] Add option to use a previous back up that was created to file menu.
    - [!] Make Table Widget the main widget instead of being a tab.
    - [!] Add way to do this in bulk.
        - [!] Take in multiple reports at one time.
    - [!] Add totals at the bottom of the table.
        - [?] Need to know how to read from table cells.
