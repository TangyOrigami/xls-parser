# Timesheet Analyzer

## TODO:
1. [!] Finish setting up the '-d' flag to run the application in debug mode.
    - [!] Flag should activate the loggers that are spread all throught the code base. 
    - [!] Add more loggers throught the code base.

2. [?] Finish db.py
    - [!] Save user.
    - [!] Needs audit to see what else this needs work on.

3. [?] Finish Table widget
    - [?] Pull data from db (requires db.py to be done).
    - [?] Add interoperability between widgets.

4. [?] Finish Dashboard widget.
    - [?] There's nothing done on this. Heavy WIP.

5. [?] Clean up code.
    - [?] This will never be done, it is purpusefully an unreachable goal.
